<h1>Hamilton in Chicago was quite the concert!</h1>

<p>Am I right ... ?</p>

<h2>And the "Hamilton" actor for Lafayette did not throw away his shot.</h2>

<p>Here's an example of one of his most difficult verses:</p>
<blockquote>And I’m never gonna stop until I make ‘em
/ Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains</blockquote>

<p>What makes it difficult is that it's one of the fastest line ever spoken on Broadway, according to analysis form FiveThirtyEight.</p>
<p>And just how fast?</p>
<h3>6.3 words per second</h3>
<p>Belmont student Chris Lee stepped into the big shoes of Daveed Diggs, a professional rapper, to the thunderous applause of the Chicago audience when he rapped that fast line. Major props to Chicago's Lafayette character!</p>
<p>Here's how the line's speed compares to other musicals that have all come to Chicago, according to FiveThirtyEight:</p>
