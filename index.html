               <h2>And the "Hamilton" actor for Lafayette did not throw away his shot.</h2>
               <p>Here's an example of one of his most difficult verses:</p>
               <blockquote>And I’m never gonna stop until I make ‘em
               / Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains
               </blockquote>
               <p>What makes it difficult is that it's one of the fastest line ever spoken on Broadway, according to analysis form FiveThirtyEight.</p>
               <p>And just how fast?</p>
               <figure>
                  <h3>6.3 words per second</h3>
               </figure>
               <p>Belmont student Chris Lee stepped into the big shoes of Daveed Diggs, a professional rapper, to the thunderous applause of the Chicago audience when he rapped that fast line. Major props to Chicago's Lafayette character!</p>
               <p>Here's how the line's speed compares to other musicals that have all come to Chicago, according to FiveThirtyEight:</p>

               <p>While Lee's verse in "Guns and Ships" isn't the fastest in history, I couldn't believe it is delivered in one breathe. That's what seems like what made it so unique.</p>
               <h2>Hamilton in Chicago by the numbers</h2>
               <p>Here's a list of some other important and fun numbers from my visit to the show:</p>
               <figure>
                  <ul>
                     <li>26 - the number of times I entered the online lottery</li>
                     <li>2 - the number of tickets I won on my 26th try</li>
                     <li>10 - the cost per ticket that I was so lucky and thankful to get</li>
                     <li>3 - the row my friend and I sat in</li>
                     <li>6 - the number of speakers that were in our view (definitely still worth it hehe)</li>
                  </ul>
               </figure>
               <aside>
                  <!-- kind of like a footer here, refering to another page -->
                  <p>See those speakers and more on 
                     <a href="pictures.html">this page</a> of my pictures from the visit.

               <h2>Another 
                  <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/blog/post/2016/09/hamilton-chicago-hacks-how-to-snag-the-hottest-theater-tickets-in-town/2422/">Site</a> Did Hamilton Chicago Pretty Well
               </h2>
               <p>The pictures' padding looks pretty good. Like how they're centered within the column. The height and the width are designated for the photos, which makes them look nice and uniform. In the source code, there's a border of zero. When I added a border by editing it, the border looked kind of silly. So that's good that they don't use that.</p>
               <p>Next, I like the h3 attribute stylings. In the .css page, there's font family, font style, and font weight. So the main css determines the style of the html page. Next, there's a user agent profile that determines some of the color and margins that really work well for breaking up the text in a way that doesn't draw attention to the headers. It also gives the reader some room to breath beneath the fold and scrolling through the article. There's a 
                  <a href="photos/site-review.png">nice graphic</a> determining the margin, border, padding, and the sub-heading size. At the same time, I don't like the spacing above the sub-heading. It seems like there's more room than necessary above it: I might want that to be more uniform.
