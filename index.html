      <h1>Hamilton in Chicago was quite the concert!</h1>
      <p>Am I right ... ?</p>

      <h2>And the "Hamilton" actor for Lafayette did not throw away his shot.</h2>
      <p>Here's an example of one of his most difficult verses:</p>
      <blockquote>And I’m never gonna stop until I make ‘em
         / Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains
      </blockquote>
      <p>What makes it difficult is that it's one of the fastest line ever spoken on Broadway, according to analysis form FiveThirtyEight.</p>
      <p>And just how fast?</p>
      <h3>6.3 words per second</h3>
      <p>Belmont student Chris Lee stepped into the big shoes of Daveed Diggs, a professional rapper, to the thunderous applause of the Chicago audience when he rapped that fast line. Major props to Chicago's Lafayette character!</p>
      <p>Here's how the line's speed compares to other musicals that have all come to Chicago, according to FiveThirtyEight:</p>

      <p>While Lee's verse in "Guns and Ships" isn't the fastest in history, I couldn't believe it is delivered in one breathe. That's what seems like what made it so unique.</p>
